# Dragon Cave
A game of random chance! Will you meet a friendly dragon who'll befriend you and share his hoard, or whill you meet a mean dragon who'll eat you for a snack? Each cave has a 1 in 4 chance of having a mean dragon. The two caves you come across may both have friendly, both have mean, or one has a friendy and the other a mean dragon.

You also have an inventory keeping track of the items the friendly dragons give you. The player can print them out when considering a cave to enter.
